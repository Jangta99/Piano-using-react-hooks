# Notes

This project is a piano using React hooks. The original source was taken here:

https://dev.to/ganeshmani/building-a-piano-with-react-hooks-3mih

I further modified it once I learned how the code works.

# How to use

Step 1: Create a new react file by typing in "npx create-react-app (your file name)".

For my project, I typed "npx create-react-app piano-using-react-hooks".

Step 2: After running this, type in "npm i soundfont-player".

Step 3: Once these two are installed, copy-and-paste the files from this Repository to the folder name. In my case, my folder name that I put all the files into was called "piano-using-react-hooks."

From there, the program should run by typing in "npm start".
